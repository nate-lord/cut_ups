	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The cut-up technique is an [chance-based] literary technique in which a text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s [to Brion Gysin cf. Beat Hotel], but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" target="_blank">William S. Burroughs</a>, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.</p>

	<p>Cutups is a web app allowing users to create, edit, style, save, share, and download cut-up texts in the style of William Burroughs and the Dadaists. Importantly, users may create wholly original (non-cut, conventional) compositions.</p>
	
	<h2>Basic user flow</h2>
	<p>The user selects one of the following combinations in generating their online document:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Two sources the input into text fields.</li>
		<li>Two pre-published sources by other authors (ex: text from craigslist rants and raves and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov.)</li>
		<li>An text-inputed source and a pre-published source.</li>
		<li>No sources. This creates a blank doc.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the user selects multiple sources the texts are folded together, one line from one source, the next from the other.</p>
	<p>An optional title and password (allowing the page to be locked) can be added.</p>
	<p>The user transitions to the new document. There the user can manipulate the document as one could with a pared-down OpenOffice text document.</p>
