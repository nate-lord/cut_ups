## Introduction

From the wikipedia page on the [cut up technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique):

> The cut-up technique is an [chance-based] literary technique in which a text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s [to Brion Gysin cf. Beat Hotel], but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [William S. Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs), and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

Cutups is a web app allowing users to **create**, **edit**, **style**, **save**, **share**, and **download** cut-up texts in the style of William Burroughs and the Dadaists. Importantly, users may create wholly original (non-cut, conventional) compositions.

## Basic user flow

The user selects one of the following combinations in generating their online document:

* Two sources the input into text fields.
* Two pre-published sources by other authors (ex: text from craigslist rants and raves and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov.)
* An text-inputed source and a pre-published source.
* No sources. This creates a blank doc.

If the user selects multiple sources the texts are folded together, one line from one source, the next from the other.

An optional title and password (allowing the page to be locked) can be added.

The user transitions to the new document. There the user can manipulate the document as one could with a pared-down OpenOffice text document.
